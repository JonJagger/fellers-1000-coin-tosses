      allows both graphs to use full width.
      Will buttons be clickable?

TODO: take values for stats? help html from real table.
      generate explanations (32 heads, 68 tails...) in code.

TODO: on re-run check no-of-steps > 100
      you lose 3rd plot...
      
TODO: colours and colourNames needs refactoring
TODO: colors: [ colours[0], colours[1], colours[2] ]
      also needs refactoring

IDEA: use grid.markings to draw vertical lines
      on top graph showing positions of steps10,100,1000

IDEA: link back to blog article

IDEA: could show 3 (say) walks on top graph.
IDEA: at end could show top-graph with all
      the walks plotted on it. Or some of them.
      And make yaxis limits cater for min/max totals.
      Would be nice tree-on-its-side shape.
