IDEA: put top-left button grid "inside" lower-graph as-well.
      allows both graphs to use full width.
      Will buttons be clickable?

IDEA: add 3 radio-buttons to explain three rows of table in stats? html
IDEA: take values for stats? help html from real table.
      generate explanations (32 heads, 68 tails...) in code.
IDEA: use grid.markings to draw vertical lines
      on top graph showing positions of steps10,100,1000

IDEA: freq[0] and lower-graph y label in same colour.
      orange?

IDEA: top graph could dynamically set yaxis min/max
      values based on no-of-steps-in-one-walk?
IDEA: link back to source
IDEA: link back to blog article

IDEA: could show 3 (say) walks on top graph.
IDEA: at end could show top-graph with all
      the walks plotted on it. Or some of them.
      And make yaxis limits cater for min/max totals.
      Would be nice tree-on-its-side shape.
