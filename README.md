Fellers-1000-coin-tosses
========================

This is a simple active web-page to simulate lots of "Feller's walks".
Each walk is 1000 steps long, and at each step you flip a fair coin.
As you walk you keep a running total (starting at zero), 
adding 1 to your total if you flip a head,
subtracting 1 from your total if you flip a tail.

What will the cumulative total look like as the number of coin flips
progresses from 1 to 1000? 

Most people's intuition is that the total will hover around zero.
Does it?

Try it!

How effective are occasional nudges back towards zero during the walk?

I discovered Feller's walk on page 77 of Don Reinersten's book
